It's a mini artificial biosphere that changes depending on outside PM levels (Particulate Matter) and SO2. PM levels change the transparency of the smart glass containing it, so the ability to see the flower because it deals with the amount of particles in our air. Then the SO2 levels change the petals closed/blooming -ness. 

My main goal is to bring awareness to the envrionmental coniditons of cities and how if this flower seems as if it is 'dying', we should be seriously thinking about the ramifications of us living in this conditions and our effects on earth. We've displaced ourselves from nature so much, we've been fooled into believing this false notion of positive "progress" due to industrialization and capitalism. We do not see the effects of our consumerist society on the planet and physical labor that upholds it. My project seeks to make our intangible relationship we now have with our envrionment and world, seen. So we no longer think of it as "out of sight, out of mind" and how it is in our hands to fix it.
