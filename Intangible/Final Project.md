## ET's Flower

It's a mini artificial biosphere that changes depending on outside PM levels (Particulate Matter) and SO2. PM levels change the transparency of the smart glass containing it, so the ability to see the flower because it deals with the amount of particles in our air. Then the SO2 levels change the petals closed/blooming -ness. My main goal is to bring awareness to the envrionmental coniditons of cities and how if this flower seems as if it is 'dying', we should be seriously thinking about the ramifications of us living in this conditions and our effects on earth.
