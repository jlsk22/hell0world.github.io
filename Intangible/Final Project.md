#### Ideation:

My first idea is an interactive wristband designed specifically for the children and elderly, who have a harder time taking in
their surrounding inputs and reacting to them quickly. If someone gets within 6ft feet of them, soft vibrations are given off 
it and a message will appear on its screen so you're aware of the bio-hazard of infection. Furthermore, it will also
measure the user's body temperature fluxuations and if it perceives a range that is influx enough to reach fever symptoms
it will inform you.

My second idea is dealing with the prompt of interacting with nature and data visualization. Although this idea is not as fleshed out yet, I'm interested in load cells and experimenting with different inputs as interactive pieces. I'm not sure yet if its possible but I would like to explore different avenues.
