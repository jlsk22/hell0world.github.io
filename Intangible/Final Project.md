#### Ideation:

<img src = "wristband.JPG" width="500" height= "400"> 

My first idea is an interactive wristband designed specifically for the children and elderly, who have a harder time taking in
their surrounding inputs and reacting to them quickly. If someone gets within 6ft feet of them, soft vibrations are given off 
it and a message will appear on its screen so you're aware of the bio-hazard of infection. Furthermore, it will also
measure the user's body temperature fluxuations and if it perceives a range that is influx enough to reach fever symptoms
it will inform you.
