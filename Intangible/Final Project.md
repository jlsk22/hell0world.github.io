#### Ideation:

My first idea is an interactive wristband designed specifically for the children and elderly, who have a harder time taking in
their surrounding inputs and reacting to them quickly. If someone gets within 6ft feet of them, soft vibrations are given off 
it and a message will appear on its screen so you're aware of the bio-hazard of infection. Furthermore, it will also
measure the user's body temperature fluxuations and if it perceives a range that is influx enough to reach fever symptoms
it will inform you.

There's been numerous reports of different deaths from corona but from people with a range of symptoms. One of the most noticeable and scary to me and my partner, who has tested positive for it, is the victim's who got better and had a perfect health record but suddenly passed from loww blood-oxygen levels. This case in particular has been the source of me and my partner's anxiety and stress because there's virutally no way to tell except if they're wearing an oximeter on all day. My project would be a weareable device (earrings, headband, bracelet) that measures a user's SP02 levels and if it drops within the dangerous range, it immediately alerts 911. I've heard of the Apple Watch doing this, but that still leaves out a significant percentage of the population who doesn't own one.

My third idea is creating a mini biosphere for a flower-plant-environment that tracks the outside humidity, temp, C02 and V02 levels and changes the inside levels depending on them. My main goal is to bring awareness to the envrionmental coniditons of cities and how if this flower dies, we should be seriously thinking about the ramifications of us living in this conditions and our surrounding earth.
