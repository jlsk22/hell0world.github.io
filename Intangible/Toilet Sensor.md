Toilet Sensor
---

#### Ideation: 
- People get shy when they're in the bathroom and will usually wait until there's no one in it to finish their business
- We wanted to create an interaction using the toilets sensors that would alleviate people's anxiety and provide a calming experience to bathrooms
- Once the person sits down and starts going, loud glacial stream sounds will play and then once they finish and leave, the toilet will flush itself 
 
#### Materials:
- 2 Proximity Sensors
- One beam breaker to signify when they are going #1 or 2, plays p5.js sound of glacial streams
- One VL53L0X Time of Flight Sensor to go off when they leave, aka triggers toilet flush 
- Chair

#### Takeaways/Challenges:
- First time doing physical computing and although it was difficult, tinkering with physical elements and programming them to do real things is exciting to me
- Connecting different softwares and filtering the data across platforms is extremely confusing, but ITP has a lot of great rescources and staff that are willing to help 
- It's easier to design and program with a problem in mind that you're solving
