Which exhibition did you see? How did you feel about the show?
What is your favorite work if you had?
What did you like about the piece?
How is intangible interaction used in the piece?
If you were the artist, what would you have done differently?

I observed the Cloud Song exhibition and I really loved all the different interpretations with nature the artist's focused on.
I think whenever engineering, art and design intersect the juxtapoisiton between them always create an interesting interaction.
For example, my favorite piece 'Point Cloud' by James Leng utilizes mechanical engineering of wires, servo motors and arduinos
to re-create the constant flux of our atmosphere. And it does it so well that it more accurately represents nature than our 
standard way of doing it like through a weather app with stock images. It made me feel so much more connected and visualize 
the immaterial forces the elements embody much better. I could sit and watch it morph all day. My next favorite was 'Project
History' by Ken Kawamoto and I also liked how Kawamoto saw an already existing way that we do something and thought we can do
better. The idea of being able to connect with someone around the world through syncing your weather incubators to each other
is also adorable and I would buy one.
