Project #2: Cranky Cube
---

Make a cube shaped object that people can interact with through intangible interaction. Your cube has either a behavior (e.g., it senses specific gestures and reacts to them with sound, it lights up when a user blows their warm breath onto it…) or personality (e.g., shy, impatient, cheerful, rude, polite, reserved, grumpy…). Your cube’s functionality or personality will not be communicated through the physical form of the object, instead, users will find them out through the process of interacting with them. Your cube can be made of any material and can be any size. You will use a APDS9960 (Proximity, Light, RGB, and Gesture Sensor) that will be provided for this assignment or any other sensors of your choice.


### Ideation:
- Humanizing the cube
- Plays snoring sounds until you get within an x distance of it, then it wakes up by either an LED light turning on or some
other indication
- Maybe starts swearing once it's been woken up 
- Needs two audio sensors (isd1820) and a gesture sensor (APDS9960)
