----> Data visulization of the number of female lives lost in domestic abuse cases in a year in Turky, using a pair of red heels to represent each women. Mounted on a cement wall for the public to raise awareness. I wanted to take the same idea of visualizing a certain topic women go through in our society.

- Input = time VS Output = you don't get to enjoy its beauty anymore
- Society views women as ageing as one of the worst apcolapyses for us, since it means we're no longer contributing our 
beauty, youth and value to it. Through media and 'elederly women' products, society caters less and less to us as they 
see our worthyness decline with our age. We are portrayed as desparate, shriveled up, ugly and witches to pressure women
into having babies (aka contributing SOMETHING to society in our leaving place), getting plastic surgery, and in the corporal
world we're just plainly fired. Many women see this as finally being set free from society's scrutiny and male gaze, free to do whatever we please free of judgement. 
- I wanted to portray women as a flower, as ageing is natural and how absurd it would be to tell a flower, "Why aren't you prettier?" But I feel as if the metaphor is lost from being viewed by itself. Easier comparison to show that the flower is women, or a way to "set it free" in the end?


## Ideation:
 - pick an object that already has loaded beauty connotations with it, then alter or pivot the "value" or "productivity" to include the subject your're trying to bring into conversation with it
 - lipstick, lingerie, tampons, blood on panties, lingerie, high heels, perfume, diets, waist trainers
 - beauty/skinny does not indicate healthy, yet we make that connection
 - "Once	women	internalize	expectations	about	their	appearance,	social	enforcement of	beauty standards is	supplemented	
 by	Foucauldian	self-surveillance,	with	women	feeling	shame	and	displeasure	when	they	fail	to	comply"
 - input vs ouptut 
 - high heels that shock you, if you fall
 - society only sees women's value as baby makers and looking pretty for the male gaze
 - lingerie that shows off the thought-of "non sexy parts of your body"

  - Evil person asks the mirror "Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who's the fairest of them all?" everyday to make sure it's still her --> symbol of systematic-biased inherently built into every every one of our algorithmic, machine learning, AI based technology that we rely on for a unviersal standard. (digital marketing algorithims, instagram/facebook/youtube trends, most reccommend videos)
 - LED-lined mirror when somebody says the key words "Mirror, mirror on the wall, whos the fairest of them all" lights up and says:
 - "I cannot make that decision because I've not been programmed to be objective"
 - "Definitely not the biased system I'm programmed on to give you an answer. You've been conned to believe through centuries of systematic societal, political and economic gaslighting and brainwashing that the only opinion that matters and has value to you, is my own because we're the ones who actually financially + politically benefit from 90% of the hyper analzyed norms we create. All you have to do is stop beleiving it, but you don't and that's why we're still on top"
