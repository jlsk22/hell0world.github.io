## Ideation:
 - pick an object that already has loaded beauty connotations with it, then alter or pivot the "value" or "productivity" to include the subject your're trying to bring into conversation with it
 - lipstick, lingerie, tampons, blood on panties, lingerie, high heels, perfume, diets, waist trainers
 - beauty/skinny does not indicate healthy, yet we make that connection
 - "Once	women	internalize	expectations	about	their	appearance,	social	enforcement of	beauty standards is	supplemented	
 by	Foucauldian	self-surveillance,	with	women	feeling	shame	and	displeasure	when	they	fail	to	comply"
 - input vs ouptut 
 - high heels that shock you, if you fall
 - society only sees women's value as baby makers and looking pretty for the male gaze
 - lingerie that shows off the thought-of "non sexy parts of your body"

  - Evil person asks the mirror "Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who's the fairest of them all?" everyday to make sure it's still her 
- Symbol of systematic-biased inherently built into every every one of our algorithmic, machine learning, AI based technology utilized to cateogrize/sort us/anaylze us, that we don't realize we culturally rely on for trends, "popular", patterns, images purposefuly bombarded on us to make us conform ----> digital marketing algorithims, instagram/facebook/youtube trends, most reccommend videos, machine-learning driven platforms

- LED-lined mirror when somebody says the key words "Mirror, mirror on the wall" lights up and has multiple responses:
 - The person 
 - "I cannot make that decision because I've not been programmed to be objective"
 - "Don't you want to know who's the nicest of them all?"
 - "Why don't you ever ask me who decides this value system you're so eager to base your life on?"
 - "Why do you care about anyone elses standard other than your own? "
 - "You've been conned to believe through centuries of systematic societal, political and economic gaslighting and brainwashing that the only opinion that matters and has value to you, is my own because we're the ones who actually financially + politically benefit from 90% of the hyper analzyed norms we create. All you have to do is stop beleiving it, but you don't and that's why we're still on top"
- Form matches Sleeping Beauty's mirror to make culutrual reference easiser
