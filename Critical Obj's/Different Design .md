#### Our given topics are:
**Amplification, Outrage, Data-Driven**

### Ideas/Topics:
- NLP: Natural Langugage Processes, converting human language to computer binary
- Data Visualization --> projection/NYC Open Data database 
- Privacy + Surveillance --> we have none now
- Alexa
- Amplification = visual element getting bigger
- Video
- Women being under-represented & undermined since the VERy beginning by men
- **Alexa, Siri, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft all use genderaized AI specifically women** 
**---> a device that when prompted for service from it, the voice instead of a polite women asking what you want instead uses sass and insults and telling you off** 

### Research aka Data - Driven Element:
- "In a world where voice-activated tech is increasingly ubiquitous, this is a major setback for gender equality. The relentless chorus of female-voiced virtual assistants reinforces the stereotype that women are passive helpers, not leaders. As those assistants move into workplaces where women are already underrepresented at the top (as of 2018, women filled only 23% of C-suite roles), correcting their biases is even more urgent.
Tech companies often defend their use of female voices as assistants by citing market research. Customers consistently rate female voices as more pleasant and agreeable. But that’s likely a reflection of existing and problematic social norms, which demand women be caring and helpful, while men can be authoritative and assertive. One study suggested that when AI gives commands instead of assistance—as with a GPS device—a male voice is actually preferred"

- “It’s a well-established phenomenon that the human brain is developed to like female voices.”
If men are often the ones building digital assistants, and those assistants are modeled after women, “I think that probably reflects what some men think about women—that they’re not fully human beings,” Kathleen Richardson, the author of An Anthropology of Robots and AI: Annihilation Anxiety and Machines, told Lewis.

- "MacDorman should know. He and fellow researchers played clips of male and female voices to people of both genders, then asked them to identify which they preferred. The researchers also measured the way participants actually responded to the voices. In a 2011 paper, they reported that both women and men said female voices came across as warmer. In practice, women even showed a subconscious preference for responding to females; men remained subconsciously neutral. “Men will say they prefer female speech, and women really do prefer it,” MacDorman says."

- " Among those who believe it makes a difference, over one-quarter (28%) believe a male voice is more likely to sell them a car and 23% say a male voice is more likely to sell them a computer. Only 7% say a female voice is more likely to sell them either."

- “Voice tech has failed by not being programmed to respond adequately to abuse,” she said. “The example of Siri stating ‘I’d blush if I could’ when told it was a bitch is a well-known example, as is Alexa replying ‘Well, thanks for the feedback’ when told ‘You’re a slut’.”

### Final Device: 
<img src = "/img/gross.jpg" width = "450" height = "500" >
It's a speaker with custom aduio clips that are meant to be Alexa's or Siri's responses. 
We presented by asking it normal questions and instead, she would respond with sassy/attitude comments and even "fuck you".
