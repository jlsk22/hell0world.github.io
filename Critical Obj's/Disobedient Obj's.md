Disobedient Object's
---
Disobedient Objects was an exhibition, curated by Catherine Flood and Gavin Grindon, of tools of social change and designed 
objects created by grassroots social movements from around the world.

"There are many ways art and design practices can be politically active. But we aren’t primarily concerned with the 
institutional frames of the sometimes isolated gestures of either ‘critical design’ or even programmes of ‘interventionist’
participatory art. Likewise ‘activist-art’ and more recently ‘design activism’ are established terms referring respectively 
to a nebulously broad range of artists’ practices or to top-down socially responsible professional design. We do not wish to 
denigrate such practices, and it is true that there are many kinds of ‘activism’, but at the same time the broad use of the 
term ‘activism’ has also functioned as an enclosure of cultural value, authenticity and impact on the part of professional 
artists, critics, designers, corporations and even NGOs. Rather, it seems imperative to begin with the actually existing but 
often unacknowledged grassroots cultures of activist social movements in order to properly contextualize the many overlapping 
current debates on art, design and social change."
