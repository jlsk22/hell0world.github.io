<img src = "/img/domestic-abuse.jpg" width = "550" height = "400">

Data visulization of the number of female lives lost in domestic abuse cases in a year in Turky, using a pair of red heels to represent each women. Mounted on a cement wall for the public to raise awareness. I wanted to take the same idea of visualizing a certain topic women go through in our society. 


### Topic: Feminism: Ageing
### Device: Metaphor-Surrealism 
### Mood: Earthy/Natural

Input = time VS Output = you don't get to enjoy its beauty anymore

Society views women as ageing as one of the worst apcolapyses for us, since it means we're no longer contributing our 
beauty, youth and value to it. Through media and 'elederly women' products, society caters less and less to us as they 
see our worthyness decline with our age. We are portrayed as desparate, shriveled up, ugly and witches to pressure women
into having babies (aka contributing SOMETHING to society in our leaving place), getting plastic surgery, and in the corporal
world we're just plainly fired. Many women see this as finally being set free from society's scrutiny and male gaze, free to do whatever we please free of judgement. 

I wanted to portray women as a flower, as ageing is natural and how absurd it would be to tell a flower, "Why aren't you prettier?" But I feel as if the metaphor is lost from being viewed by itself. Easier comparison to show that the flower is women, or a way to "set it free" in the end?
