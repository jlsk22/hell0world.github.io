Mariam is a junior based in Maryland right now. Similarly, she went to a STEM high school and took AP Computer Science. 
And also hated it too. Like so many of us, she started in a different major and ended up in IDM. She wants to be a video 
editor/photographer, but also explore other mediums like web design and UX. We both don’t read as much as we’d like to.
She is a little quiet but very sweet.

Jay is very into video games and a YouTube/Twitch boy. One of his favorite games are Minecraft and other PC games. He was
also a CS major first before finding IDM and he recently built his own PC during quarantine. He is very friendly and amiable.
