Feedback:
- What did you mean by abstract?
-Derek: Start doing dummy voiceovers as soon as possible since making audio sound professional can be tricky. Be comfortable with the mic setup you have.
- George: Blender 3D has been my bread and butter for 5 years and counting. Let me know if you need help with that!
-Jason: Have you considered using 2d animation with 3d assets?
- Chris: learning a new program to enhance the final product is definitely a good idea; it might be best to do as much as you can in your primary software first then add the 3D to enhance.
- debbie: would it all be in your voice or would you add other voices as well (thinking about the mom testimonial)
