#### F. _Edited_ POC: Drinking tea with the holder/bag/ball still in it is difficult 
Market: Tea-bag strainers/holders

I decided to change my prototypes based on a product I found that I thought was smart and very close to what I envisioned for my own but it still lacked the elements I'm striving for: 

<img src = "/img/teaman.jpg" width = "300" height = "300">
<img src = "/img/teaman2.jpg" width = "300" height = "400">

#### G. Existing Strengths/Weaknesses: 
- Biggest critique was that the design was counter-intuitive since the holes to strain the tea were too big and loose leaves fall through to the bottom of your container
- Many people also said none of their designs sit low-enough in the cup and all floated to the surface and therefore, couldn't be drank with it
- The pop-off silicone part is also very flimsey and loose as the holder piece
- Everybody loved the cute and personable designs and said it attracted them to their product most and how they hang off the edge

#### H. Revised Ideation:
