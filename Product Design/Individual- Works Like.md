### Deliverables for 3/26/20: Looks-Like Prototype

Upon studying my first prototypes, I narrowed in on key factors that pre-exisiting products do not do and why and then ideated further on models that fix them. I figued this is a very chartered and small market so it's smarter for me to ideate on already made designs, because I don't need to re-invent the wheel, and incorporate features that my product will fix. 

I started with the handle being grounded to the cup. What I found was that a mold around the edge and a hook technique are best and most applicable to any cup and allow the consumer to STILL drink from their cup while in it. Although any method I tried would work, since I'm using a weighted-bottom form, these two are the easiest skeletons to build a cute design out of. The next problem I identified from the pre-existing products was that they all floated around in the cup due to their designed forms. So moving forward, now that I know how it is going to be grounded to the cup and the general S-form nature of the strainer, the last thing to ideate is the looks-like design. 

I can pull inspiration from some of my first designs, since I started unknowingly ideating the looks-like before. I'm going to attempt the **fishing-pole and leaf design**. Looking at the market most strainers are made out of staintless steel fine mesh with BPA-free soft silicon.

### Materials: 
- clay, instamorph, model-magic 
- paint or dye with a matte finish
- stainless steel fine mesh (take from frankenstein models)


### Inspiration: 
- I would like the bottom tea strainer to look like this, with the metal mesh being able to pop on/off easily and with the weight distribution toward bottom so it acts as anchor by itself. Clost to fish design looks-ike this but mine will be made out of the soft silicon material

 - I want all the designs to have an S-form like this one, except the tie between the anchor and attachment to cup will be sturdier (see also that this one still floats in cup due to material of strainer part, not weighted-enough)
