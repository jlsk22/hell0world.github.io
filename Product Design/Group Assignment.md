 ### Weakness/Strengths:
- Insulated/Weighted bowl does well with mixing in different ingredients and doesn’t move across countertops but cannot be put in dishwasher friendly + UGLY
- The OXO bowl is great at staying/sticking to surfaces, but not easily moveable once filled
- The anti-slip bowl incorporates a place mat that is also cleanable but once the metal bowls are set in, they cannot be moved in or out conveniently 
- The gyro bowl is a cool concept, but brings in a new problem with its design - even though it might prevent a lot of food from being spilled, if knocked over it could roll away
- The Non-skid bowl solves efficiency but requires many units to create an entire set to use + not cost effective 

### Ideation: 
- A bowl with a plate-like platform underneath
- A bowl that sits in a small crevice in a table
- A magnetic bowl or a bowl with a magnetic bottom that sticks to a magnetic platform
- A silicone coaster for a bowl (coaster with a small crevice for the bowl to sit in)
- A bowl that attaches to any table/surface
- A bowl with a slot for the utensil (If you’ve seen the ramen bowls with a hole in the bowl for chopsticks)

### Outliers:
- Table that has a bowl cut-out
- Moldable tablecloth for each bowl setting
