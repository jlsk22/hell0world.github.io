 ### Weakness/Strengths:
- Insulated/Weighted bowl does well with mixing in different ingredients and doesn’t move across countertops but cannot be put in dishwasher friendly + UGLY
- The OXO bowl is great at staying/sticking to surfaces, but not easily moveable once filled
- The anti-slip bowl incorporates a place mat that is also cleanable but once the metal bowls are set in, they cannot be moved in or out conveniently 
- The gyro bowl is a cool concept, but brings in a new problem with its design - even though it might prevent a lot of food from being spilled, if knocked over it could roll away
- The Non-skid bowl solves efficiency but requires many units to create an entire set to use + not cost effective 

### Ideation: 
- A bowl with a plate-like platform underneath
- A bowl that sits in a small crevice in a table
- A magnetic bowl or a bowl with a magnetic bottom that sticks to a magnetic platform
- A silicone coaster for a bowl (coaster with a small crevice for the bowl to sit in)
- A bowl that attaches to any table/surface
- A bowl with a slot for the utensil (If you’ve seen the ramen bowls with a hole in the bowl for chopsticks)

### Outliers:
- Table that has a bowl cut-out
- Moldable tablecloth for each bowl setting

## 2/20:

Problem Statement - Empty plastic bowls with metal utensils topple over due to their lightweight material.

#### Brainstorm:
- A bowl with a plate-like platform underneath
- A bowl that sits in a small crevice in a table
- A magnetic bowl or a bowl with a magnetic bottom that sticks to a magnetic platform
- A silicone coaster for a bowl (coaster with a small crevice for the bowl to sit in)
- A bowl that attaches to any table/surface
- A bowl with a slot for the utensil (If you’ve seen the ramen bowls with a hole in the bowl for chopsticks)

#### Ideas we want to prototype:
- Bowl with plate/platform underneath
- Bowl w/ magnetic bottom + platform
- Bowl with utensil slot

##### Assumptions we want to test:
- A platform underneath a bowl will prevent the bowl from tipping over
- A bowl with a magnetic bottom that sticks to a metal platform will make the overall system more stable
- A slot for metal utensils would help distribute the weight more evenly, increasing balance and making it less likely for the bowl to topple over

##### Product Features:
Must have:
- Main component of the product is the bowl itself, which is made out of a lightweight plastic
- A secondary component would keep the bowl in place if it’s about to fall over - this could be a magnet, platform, slot, etc.
Nice to have:
- Versatile: fits any bowl size/shape
Could have:
- Suited for a variety of uses - adults, children, animals, etc.
Won’t have (right now):
- Incredibly lightweight as well as be a singular component
