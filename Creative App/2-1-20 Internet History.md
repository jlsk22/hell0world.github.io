Internet History: A Declaration in the Independence of Cyberspace
--

After you've done the readings, post a 300-500 word response about the history of the Internet. Was it a surprise to you? 
Do you consider this your history? Barlow's declaration, in particular, is a famous document in Internet history because it
captures the promise and orientation of many early hackers to the Internet when it was first being shaped. Do you agree with 
his claims, and do you think they still exist today? Submit using homework form, week 5.2.

I've read the history of the internt before and although it doesn't surprise me that the initial push came from the US's 
Arms Race with the Soviet Union, James Barlow's words were very interesting and though-provoking to me. I did not know such
a formal document of sovereignty at the founding time of the internet existed but I feel it is more than justified and 
appropriate. Many people at its start were extremely skeptical and dismissive of the capabilities of it. I've seen 
footages of anchorman and news channels reporting it to be equavalent to mere child's play. From what I understood
from Barlow's words is that he really did mean for cyberspace to be a digital dafe haven and solution from the tyrannies of man
and systems we've enacted to rule each other. But I believe he did not estimate the fact that even a digital platform where
our bodies do not exist and therefore be physically coerced, is still subject to human's faults and injustices. If anything,
I believed Cyberspace really could've been it's own unchartered anamoly, almost a utopian of what Barlow intended and wanted
for it. But I believe humans have an innate quality in them of selfishness and greed and after it's development, we tainted it
with our values and even systematic failures we were trying so hard to escape from. For example, Barlow talks about cyberspace
and us on it as a one unified cell that doesn't need laws because it will impose its own laws and solutions on it when 
necessary and that's why we don't need the corruption of governments or law in it. However evidence today clearly shows that it
is untameable and unable to be regulated but that doesn't disprove the existence of the problems we've created on it that we're 
stil not capable of solving ourselves. The Dark Web is my main example where it's just made crime and evil intentions even more
accessible and conveinent. Barlow's claims failed to address the fact that the internet is comprised off millions of sectorized
groups of individuals and the common thread, of us being on the internet, is not enough to unify us and solve the problems we 
face on it. However, I don't think this was a filure of Barlow, more so our ability to forsee and predict the unknown. Instead 
I believe it speaks volumes about the nature of humans and we cannot help but bring our own messy, chaotic and unstable habits,
tendencies, and nature into it.
