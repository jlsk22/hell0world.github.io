- Evil person asks the mirror "Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who's the fairest of them all?" everyday to make sure it's still her --> symbol of systematic-biased inherently built into every every one of our algorithmic, machine learning, AI based technology utilized to cateogrize/sort us/anaylze us, that we don't realize we culturally rely on for trends, "popular", patterns, images purposefuly bombarded on us to make us conform ----> digital marketing algorithims, instagram/facebook/youtube trends, most reccommend videos, machine-learning driven platforms
- LED-lined mirror when somebody says the key words "Mirror, mirror on the wall, whos the fairest of them all" lights up and says:
 - "I cannot make that decision because I've not been programmed to be objective"
 - "Do you ever wonder who's actually behind this face? The programmers/companies creating the responses I give you... AI and machine learning is far from creating a autonomous digital entity that can think freely think for itself. You must question if you ever wish to see the truth of your society. "
 - "Why don't you ever ask me who's the nicest of them all? Y'all arrogant"
 - "Why don't you ever ask me who decides this value system you're so eager to base your life on? I'm merely a system programmed to find already pre-existing cutural, societal and political patterns present and re-project them back onto you. AI and machine-based learning is rarely based on progessive, forward-thinking. When you leave the same people in power for so long, they repeat history on purpose for their own finanical gain."
 - "You've been conned to believe through centuries of systematic societal, political and economic gaslighting and brainwashing that the only opinion that matters and has value to you, is my own because we're the ones who actually financially + politically benefit from 90% of the hyper analzyed norms we create. All you have to do is stop beleiving it, but you don't and that's why we're still on top"
