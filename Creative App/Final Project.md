- Evil person asks the mirror "Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who's the fairest of them all?" everyday to make sure it's still her 
- Symbol of systematic-biased inherently built into every every one of our algorithmic, machine learning, AI based technology utilized to cateogrize/sort us/anaylze us, that we don't realize we culturally rely on for trends, "popular", patterns, images purposefuly bombarded on us to make us conform ----> digital marketing algorithims, instagram/facebook/youtube trends, most reccommend videos, machine-learning driven platforms

- LED-lined mirror when somebody says the key words "Mirror, mirror on the wall" lights up and has multiple responses:
 - The person 
 - "I cannot make that decision because I've not been programmed to be objective"
 - "Don't you want to know who's the nicest of them all?"
 - "Why don't you ever ask me who decides this value system you're so eager to base your life on?"
 - "Why do you care about anyone elses standard other than your own? "
 - "You've been conned to believe through centuries of systematic societal, political and economic gaslighting and brainwashing that the only opinion that matters and has value to you, is my own because we're the ones who actually financially + politically benefit from 90% of the hyper analzyed norms we create. All you have to do is stop beleiving it, but you don't and that's why we're still on top"
- Form matches Sleeping Beauty's mirror to make culutrual reference easiser

## Ideal location: 

- I see this being in a gallery or museum most complemented with a collection about societal standards on women and technologies interference
- The audience would be the public, so if I went with sketch # 2, the person responding would be an expert on AI/Machine-learning on digital platforms or someone who's skill set allows them to have dynamic conversations with the audience and has sufficient knowledge to explore the public's relationship with societal limitiations imposed on us by digital marketing/social media
- Aka someone who can aid them in thinking deeper about the connection made between the psychology behind Sleeping Beauty's Mirror to the evil villian and the willing part we play in following digital patterns/trends
