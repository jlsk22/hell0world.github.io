I read "Stealth Infrastructure" by Julian Oliver and it reminds me of an old memory I've had since a child of seeing these
fake cell towers "disguised" in plain day. I remember as a kid thinking, "ok so this is something we all just notice, accept,
and move on with" but always wondering what the story behind it meant. You figure, if someone is trying that hard to disguise
a device in plain sight, then it can't be good. What shocks me most about the article though is, how everyone who sees it never
really thinks to look further and everyone nervously "accepts" them or lets these network companies think we don't see them.
Honestly, I'm not too shocked by Oliver's findings because technology has blurred the lines of every sector of our society 
today and it's so on-brand for our government to take complete advantage of that. But I'm surprised about how easily Oliver 
was able to find out that our defense force actually controls and disguises themselves as network comapnies to spy on us. It's 
funny to me how they didn't try too hard to hide it but also not a lot of people, other than Oliver, have really thought to 
care about it. There is so much blind trust and faith in a society... It makes me such a nihilist at heart.
