***What are the experiences like of different people online? Are there inequities that are built into the medium***

Once you've finished the readings, choose two of them to respond to. Write 300-400 words about how the advertising model of the
web is related to the concepts that we discussed last week. Be sure to note the things about the Internet specifically that are
standing out to you—remember that you'll be making a work tied to one of these things soon! (Submit using homework form, week 
7.1)

I read all three this week. I cannot believe the talk "The Internet With a Human Face" by Maciej Cegłowski was given in 2014!
He definitely brings up many critical and cruical points that map a future with the internet and technology surveillance as
one we will not be proud of. It reminded me of a talk about technology and ethics I had once seen and how companies need to 
take responsibility and have forward-future thinking about the supposed projections and implications of their products or else
no one will be held accountable and the problem will continue to worsen. We already know the acute and massive effects of 
social media on our psyches and related to mental illness. And those apps initially started out with the main priority to
simply share one form of data on a singular platform with one another. Nobody knew or could predict the influence Facebook, Instagram and Twitter would have today. It's scary and frightening because if no privatized company is willing to have that 
accountability or even discussion, then it leads me to believe that the only way this cycle will end is IF the government were 
to take the torch. And that though, is laughable. There's always the hope that a president might have the intuition and 
critical thinking to realize this but based on these elections and how generational thinking works- that hope is a lost cause
as well.
