Although not extremely visible, the internet infrastructure around East Williamsburg, Brooklyn isn't trying to hide itself
either. Mostly mounted on roofs, side of buildings, and on sidewalks, the wires connecting them are strewn between buildings
usually in alleyways or on the non-street sides of apartments. I definitely look at our country's secular way of dealing with
it much differently than I used to. My independent and rebel side is peeved I didn't think about it before but moreso about 
the fact that many countries who don't provide nearly the same access and convenience to their citizens, combat this
by building their own self-reliant systems. An intelligence and independence I hope to acquire one day. 
However, I can't shake the feeling that it's purposeful though. It doesn't feel like a coincidence that the U.S., one of the 
most priviledged countries when it comes to internet and tech access, does their absolute most to hide it from our plain sight. And I'm mostly referring to the wealthiest areas such as: silicon valley, LA, manhattan etc. that benefit from the top
1% of wealth distribution while the rest of the country lags behind and unheard. I believe the country allocates their resources to specifically hiding the internet infrastructure the most from them because if there were made visible to it and
more aware, then they would question. They would use their money to build their own, if they were smart enough, instead of supporting and giving the US government their money and aka "contribution". Obviously this is a shortened and half-ass explanation and the top 1% owns these internet carriers and other tech avenues, so they're probably complacent in it all as well and knowledgable. But I believe there's a major ignorance gap between Upper to middle-upper and midder-lower classes,
who're still reaping the benefits of the working class but also being finely manipulated in these infrastructural and secular
ways by the top.... 
Just some thoughts and maybe a possible topic to research more for my project.
