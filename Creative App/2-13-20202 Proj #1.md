For my repsonse piece, I chose to respond to *The Weather Project* by Olfaur Elliasson found [here](https://olafureliasson.net/archive/watch/MDA110833/the-weather-project). 

What initially attracted to me to this piece was the way people were interacting with it and how the installation left 
enough creative space for people to find their own interpretations and express themeselves through it. The idea was simple
but it acted as a vehicle for observers to move and feel connected through it. I stuck with this idea of how when humans
look at nature or the environment we're becoming aware of how minisucle we're compared to it and its beauty de-centralizes ourselves from our own seflish worlds to look at the bigger picture of this whole planet we're all living on. Through my
response I hope to create a pathos of earthy beauty and connection. 



#### Draft 1 of some sketches of installations/pieces :

#### Process: 
--> Went with hologram/heat installation.

first started by making the plastic triangular structure by laser cutting acrylic.

Next I programmed an Arudino to heat up two thermoeletric modules by flipping a switch. 
Then, I sautered and wired two fans to a plug in wall adapter and attached them to the two heaters. 
Lastly I made a strucutre to hold up my Ipad which has the projection video and placed the fans on either side.
