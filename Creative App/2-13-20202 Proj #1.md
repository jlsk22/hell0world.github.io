For my repsonse piece, I chose to respond to *The Weather Project* by Olfaur Elliasson found [here](https://olafureliasson.net/archive/watch/MDA110833/the-weather-project). 

What initially attracted to me to this piece was the way people were interacting with it and how the installation left 
enough creative space for people to find their own interpretations and express themeselves through it. The idea was simple
but it acted as a vehicle for observers to move and feel connected through it. I stuck with this idea of how when humans
look at nature or the environment we're becoming aware of how minisucle we're compared to it and its beauty de-centralizes ourselves from our own seflish worlds to look at the bigger picture of this whole planet we're all living on. Through my
response I hope to create a pathos of earthy beauty and connection.

#### Process: 
----> Went with 3D Sun hologram/heat installation (lower right sketch), since I was initally  interested in the organic nature to how people were responding to this fake sun as if it were a real one. And I wanted to recreate a feeling of being somewhere/someplace else. I wanted to make a space where people felt connected by its beauty to each other and the universe. 

First, I started by making the plastic triangular structure by laser cutting acrylic that I purchased. Using instructions for dimensions found online [here](https://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Holograms-Using-Phone/)

<img src = "/img/acrylic.jpg" width = "400" height = "400" >

Next I programmed an Arudino to heat up two thermoeletric modules by flipping a switch and LED to indicate it's on/off state. Using online resources found online [here](https://medium.com/@ali.atwa/how-to-use-a-peltier-with-arduino-a35b0d4e52c2)

Then, I sautered and wired two fans to a plug into a wall adapter and attached them to the two module heaters. 
Using instrucutables I found online [here](youtube.com/watch?v=evQtPGJe7xM)

<img src = "/img/fan1.jpg" width = "600" height = "500" >
<img src = "/img/fan2.jpg" width = "600" height = "500" >

Lastly I made a structure to hold up my Ipad, which has the 3D projection video and placed the fans on either side of the structure. I played a 3D video of flowers blooming that I found on youtube and added the song "Space Song" by Beach House. Video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/dXBoAqhh4g4)

### Final Thoughts:
- Overall, I'm surprised and proud that it works! First time programming an Arduino to do a specific physical task. I realized there's a plethora of online resources and knlowedge online which I found super helpful, since I'm a visual learner. I account most of the project's success to that, as well as Resident Office Hours and help from TA's. 
- Next time, definitely need more time for final fabrification. For a 2.0, I would like to maybe put it in a box with only eye-holes on four sides where 4 people can view it at once. That way the hologram can be best seen from eye level and in a dark-space instead of having to display it in a pitch-black room. Makes it more enclosed and personal and easier for viewer to experience it. 
- I would also like to program the fans to be turned on by the Arudino instead of plug-ins and either swap that interactivity in for something else, maybe put the entire Ipad on a rotating raised platform instead or create a blinking LED light display with it.
