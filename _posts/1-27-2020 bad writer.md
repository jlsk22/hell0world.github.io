Bad Writers by Michael Ahmad

Why do you think I've asked you to read this piece? 
What connection does it have to our class? 


The process at which Ahmad elicits and debunks the fundementals and conformity of bad writing is a process we can all
apply to some part of our lives. He covers many topics in writing that many creatives and artists struggle with
such as: creativity, subjectivity, attitude and ego. I found it particularly funny that many bad writers will take offense, 
like any other starting novice, to constructive criticism because they are personally offended by it. Ahmad makes a very 
clear distinction that they are not criticizing or doubting the validity of the author's feelings or factual legitimacy of 
the piece. But rather being a bad writer and writing about something meaningful to you are two exclusive things. Often times, 
we group them together because our work is a reflection of us and the feedback feels personal to our core. Something we should
all keep in mind about our work and instead of responding with cliches about another great erudite whom you copied, remember
that what makes your work original, creative and different is that you are making it _your_ way. And if we wish to grow our 
abilities, we must demand more from ourselves and learning from revisions, criticism and feedback is essential.
