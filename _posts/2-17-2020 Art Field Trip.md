"New York Clearing" by Sir Anthony Gormely

Document your experience and write about the exhibition, show, or work that you visited for your homework. Questions to 
use as starting places: What exhibition or event did you go to? What work stood out to you? If none of them did, why not? 
What didn't resonate with you? Describe the mood, the tone, and the qualities of the work, and then describe your reactions. 
How did the context of the work—including but not limited to staging and curation—affect your understanding? Did you look at 
the wall text or ask anyone for context on the work?

For this assignment, I went and observed "New York Clearing" by Sir Anthony Gormely. It is an outdoor installation of giant
loops of metal wrapped and connected to each other, almost like a giant slinkey bent into a ball. It was set on the Pier 2 by 
the Brooklyn Bridge and had a great view of Manhattan's skyline from it. It initially felt cold, reflective and had a finality 
to it. I most connected to the fact that in order to experience it you had to physically bend over, weave and also slink your 
way through it. There was something very appealing about looking up at the circular pattern of the looops once in it and it 
did feel organic to me. I understood the ordered chaos nature of it and how New Yorkers often grapple and jump through a mess 
of situations and decisions on the daily- much like this installation was leading you to do. Although an installation, to me it
felt like it lacked an element of complete immersion or feeling like you're immersed enough in it to get out of your own head
space and contemplate this new envrionment Gormely had formed. Mayve due to the industrial, think metal loops and overall
transparency of the piece as a whole. After doing some research on Gormley's prime motive for this project, and its
just one piece in a BTS sponsored global art installations, was to relate to the art tour's theme of CONNECTION. Knowing this
context, I understand the conceptualization behind it however I still feel as if I fall flat of the feeling of 
interconnectedness between us all that I believe they wished to promote through it. 

It also had a series of installations leading to it, so I decided to go and document the ones I liked as well. Espeically 
beacuse I'm experimenting with the idea of working with mirrors in my response piece and one of them happened to play with
them. The mirrors were set up in a centralized manner, as in there was a clear middle where all the mirrors wanted to 
lead you to. It made it feel a little ritualistic and purposeful. The most important thing I observed with it though was
that many people didn't care to find the middle but most were interested in simply looking at themselves in them. That 
interaction betweeen people and looking at their image was very note-worthy to me and if I use mirrors in mine I know I want
their to be more invovlement and I'm leaning toward mixing medias with them to do so.
