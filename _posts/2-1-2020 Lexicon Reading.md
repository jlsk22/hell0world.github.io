After you've done the readings, write 400-500 words on your relationship to art, and specifically what forms of creative 
content inspire you. What types of things do you think about when you imagine the work you'd like to create? You can talk 
about books, movies, anime, plays, musicals, graphic novels, poetry, installations, fanfiction/fanart, or any form of 
creative content. What is it that inspires you about it specifically? Is it the tone, the way it makes you feel, the 
design work, the twists in the story, etc? You're here in a program about making art (or at the very least in a class 
about it), how do you see your relationship to creative content?


  My relationship to art is one that feels very desparate, intense and a deep-rooted yearning. At a young age, I really enjoyed
traditional drawing during my freetime and it took until college to make me realize that it fulfills the emptiness in me
in a way that nothing else has come close to. It feels like one of the only outlets I have to feel correctly expressed and 
acknowledged by even myself. Almost as if I prefer communication through digital art and languages rather than the human tongue
because it feels limiting to me, as well as our physical world. I have been very intrepid however to claim myself as an artist 
because my inspirations and mediums I utilize fall on a big spectrum. 
  The subjects and topics that most inspire me are: modern feminism, mixed race identity issues, debunking the 
patriarchy/capitalistic society we live in, individual expression and freedom > conformity, wealthy-disparity within our 
economic and societal strcutures, loneliness and an innate connection with the universe and between humanity. It is my life goal
if I can create art and work that accurately translates how I experience them into the physical realm and if done right,
other people can see themselves in it too. My life purpose is to help us as a species feels less lonely and realize we are
all connected. I'm on the pursuit of expressing the realness, reality and their complexities through surrealism. 
  One of the first times I saw art that was so beautiful it made me look outside of myself and realize that the function of art 
is to show rather than tell was when I watched a Hayao Miyazaki film. Specifically "Howl's Moving Castle" and "Sprited Away", 
I had no idea animation and emotions could be comunicated visually through such a beauitful way that without words. An unspoken
understanding. This lead me to pursue film and motion graphics, which I found directing and post-production editing to be a 
passion of mine. While tv shows such as: FleaBag/pen15/Tuca & Bertie/Broad City, have made me realize how much I want to also 
work on a tv-show or movie production that explores the topics I mentioned above. Specifically, Sean Baker the director of 
Tangerine and The Florida Project have been one of the biggest infleuncers in my life and shaping my own artistic vision
through film. 
  I'm most interested in visualizing the things that are unseeen in this world such as: pathos from life and music mixed with 
emotionally-heavy topics/taboos. Recently, through influences such as I-D magazine and @florencegiven/@yumisakugawa on 
Instagram, I've gotten into illustrations with words or poetry that are both humorous and informative of this organic connection
between us and the earth and each other. I like to depict spirituality, modern feminism and human connection. This has also 
challenged me to eplore other avenues and I also see myself creating a book of these illustrations or editoral work and graphic
design for magazines.
